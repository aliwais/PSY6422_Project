# PSY6422_MapProject

This project presents a map showing the death rate due to Parkinson's disease in the United States from 2005 to 2021, with a focus on the variation of the disease impact across different states. By highlighting the evidence of the disease impact on a state-by-state basis, this map aims to increase awareness about Parkinson's disease and encourage funding and research for this debilitating illness. Additionally, the map aims to emphasize the importance of providing support to families affected by Parkinson's disease, whether they have a member living with the disease or have lost someone to it. Overall, this document aims to contribute to efforts to improve the management of Parkinson's disease in the United States.
